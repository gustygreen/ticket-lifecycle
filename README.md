<p>
In this example, the ticket's priority is set to Emergency due to its potential impact on a critical business area. The SLA plan has been updated accordingly, and the ticket is assigned to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers can set their own SLA plans.

<p>
The ticket was closed after identifying the root cause as personal miskeying issues on the customerâ€™s end. The status was set to Resolved, and an internal note was added to inform the Admin that the issue has been successfully resolved.
